# challenge-5-schedule
This challenge was to create a scheduler with timeblocks for each hour in the work day. Each time block was supposed to be color coded to based on whether it is in the past present or future. This application required knowledge of moment.js. Moment allows your application to input the current time and date. Unfortunately, on my application the code I inputted in order for the rows to change color did not work. I even added a local storage code, but that did not work as well. I tried my hardest for it to work but unfortunately was unable to make these two things work, but the code is written for them.
